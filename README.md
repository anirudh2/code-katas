# code-katas

A code kata a software development exercise where a  
developer seeks to regularly **practice** new skills within a fixed amount of time, 
the kata practice session.

The code variant of a kata derives from the karate kata, an exercise 
focusing on repetition of a form with incremental improvement every time
a form is repeated.

Code katas should have a duration of 30 to 90 minutes.  The focus of a code
kata is **not** to solve a problem, as is typically the task of software
engineering.   Rahter, the focus is on **practice** of a particular code
skill, such as file IO.

A hypothetical comparison between code development and code kata (practice) follows:

|  | code development | code kata |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| time | open ended | 30 to 90 minutes |
| frequency | as needed | daily/weekly |
| objective | problem solution | skill practice |
